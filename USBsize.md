USB key size
---
you need a flash drive with at least 8 GB of space.
This is the minimum requirement recommended by Microsoft.
However, using a 16 GB or larger drive is often better.
A bigger drive allows room for updates and extra tools.
Since the Windows ISO file is about 5â€“6 GB, more space ensures a smoother setup process.
