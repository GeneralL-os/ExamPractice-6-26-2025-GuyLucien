Are multiple boots possible
---
Yes, you can create a USB drive that can boot multiple operating systems or tools.
This is called a multiboot USB drive.
Free tools like YUMI, Ventoy, and WinSetupFromUSB make this easy to set up.
They let you add several ISO files to one USB and create a menu to choose from at startup.
This is useful for technicians or users who need different systems on one drive.
